<h1>Smart Traffic and Parking Inc</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The project at Smart Traffic and Parking Inc. focused on the proposal for developing a smart traffic management system for downtown Miami. The objective was to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion by proposing the deployment of IoT-enabled sensors in parking garages. These sensors would gather real-time data on parking occupancy, traffic patterns, and vehicle movement, which could then be used to dynamically adjust traffic signals and flow based on current conditions.
<br /><br />
We aimed to create a more efficient and responsive traffic system that could adapt to real-time data. The IoT sensors would communicate with traffic management systems to optimize signal timings and parking availability, improving the overall efficiency of the transportation network.
<br /><br />
Our team collaborated to design a strategic plan that outlined the network infrastructure required to support seamless data transmission from the sensors. We conducted research to address potential network performance challenges, troubleshoot connectivity concerns, and ensure reliable communication. Additionally, we considered basic cybersecurity measures to safeguard the IoT devices from potential threats.
